# Documentation

This is the landing page for "The Negation Game", a Web3 native collective sense-making app. The game is currently in an "open alpha" stage, which means it is still under active development with new features and improvements being added regularly.

## Getting Started

To get started with "The Negation Game", you can visit the official website at [Negation Game Website](https://www.negationgame.com) or contact the development team for more information at [Contact Us](mailto:will@veeo.io).

## Development

The landing page is statically generated from React & TypeScript using Vite. Site content can be updated in the `content.ts` and `assets/md/body.md` files. The `Md` component is used to render markdown files dynamically.

To deploy the latest version to 'github pages', run the script `yarn deploy`
