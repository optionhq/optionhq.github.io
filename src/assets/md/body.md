The negation game is a new form of collective reasoning and decision-making.
Designed with DAOs in mind, it's Web3 native, open-source, and permissionless.

#### The rules are simple:

- Anyone can make a point
- Anyone can make a counterpoint (I don't think this point is true)
- Anyone can raise an objection (I don't think this point counts)
- Anyone can offer an alternative (I think this is true instead)

What emerges is an elegant and intuitive process for collective sense-making.

The game is available now and free to play: all you need is a [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) wallet.
